# Dublicate_rows_for_excel
The small script will duplicate excel rows depending on what number you put as quantity.
Al you have to do is clone the script called csv.php, make sure the quantity field is on column 9 (10-1 for array use).
Change then name to you CSV file on the csv.php file.

I did not try a large file so try at your own risk.

Why I wrote this script?

I have shopify and a Dymo label printer
When I print labels on Dymo I have to edit the excel and add new rows for each item that has more than one quantity.
When I'm dealing with over 100 rows this task can get tedious.
This script automatically duplicates rows with more than 1 quantity.

Let me know if you have any questions and Enjoy :)
